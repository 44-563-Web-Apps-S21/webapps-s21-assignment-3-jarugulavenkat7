        <p>
        I love Spending multiple hours on the trail, climbing around boulders, rock hopping, and ascending 
        hills give me whole body a workout, improving my <b>strength, agility, and cardio fitness.</b> 
        It's also a fantastic way to <b>lose weight andÂ burn calories</b> while trekking. 
        And it is always fun trekking with friends. My favorite places in India for trekking are
        <b>Sinhagad Fort, Visapur, and Pratapgad.</b>
