        <h6>My favorite activity : Trekking</h6>
        <p>
        I love Spending multiple hours on the trail, climbing around boulders, rock hopping, and ascending 
        hills give me whole body a workout, improving my <b>strength, agility, and cardio fitness.</b> 
        It's also a fantastic way to <b>lose weight andÂ burn calories</b> while trekking. 
        And it is always fun trekking with friends. My favorite places in India for trekking are
        <b>Sinhagad Fort, Visapur, and Pratapgad.</b>

        <h1>Java (programming language)</h1> 

        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)"> Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language
         that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
         It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application 
         developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),meaning that compiled
          Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need 
          for recompilation.Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode
           that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying 
           computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has 
           fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides
            dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that
             are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019,
              Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use 
              according to GitHub, particularly for client-server web applications,
               with a reported 9 million developers </blockquote>
